We believe that proportional distribution of heat pumps according to some measure is a more realistic scenario than equal distribution across all boroughs. The D’hondt method is an apportionment method developed to distribute seats in a legislative body proportionally to some measure, typically votes or population. Different apportionment methods have been developed because exact proportionally is often not possible due to the issue of fractional seats. These different methods have different properties, and empirical studies show that the D’hondt method is one of the least proportional apportionment methods, favoring large parties with the most votes. We determined that this property does not present concerns for our application, and may even be favorable. We used the D’hondt method to distribute heat pumps by borough in Alaska according to heat pump efficiency (a proxy for feasibility) and population. We recognize that there are many factors that contribute to whether or not a heat pump is installed, but we believe the most important factor is feasibility, or how well a heat pump can actually heat a space. After all, if a heat pump cannot be used as a primary heating source, the motivation to install one greatly decreases. We also wanted to incorporate population to a lesser degree given economies of scale; we believe that boroughs with larger populations will have an easier time working with installers and maintainers. To combine these two factors into one measure, we used the following formula: $rank(efficiency) * rank(efficiency) * rank(population)$. This priorities efficiency over population and addresses the problem that the distribution of heat pump efficiency across the boroughs is uniform.")),

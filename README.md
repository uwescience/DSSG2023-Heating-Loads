# DSSG2023-Heating-Loads

This branch contains exploratory analyses on the five census units in Alaska, including (1) Boroughs and Census Areas, (2) Places (Cities and CDPs), (3) Census Tracts, (4) Block, and (5) Groups Blocks. This includes preliminary visualizations and exploration of 
population variables. All shapefiles are taken from [Alaska's Department of Labor and Workforce Development](https://live.laborstats.alaska.gov/cen/maps-gis). The geographical maps are stored in the [Output/Figures folder](https://github.com/uwescience/DSSG2023-Heating-Loads/tree/boundaries/Output/Figures).
